# CommuteAlarm

Provide the location of your workplace, when you need to arrive, and how long it takes for you to prepare, and CommuteAlarm will wake you up at the right time. 

CommuteAlarm will adjust based on traffic and historical prepararation time so you can maximize your sleep time and commute efficiently.

Built at PennApps XV with [Jeffrey Fung](https://github.com/jeff1216), [Kevin Tang](https://github.com/icevin), and Dev Patel using the Android SDK and Google Maps/Places API.
